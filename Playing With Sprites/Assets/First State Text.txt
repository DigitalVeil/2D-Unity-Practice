Temporal Isolation

The steady hum of a distant generator served as a backdrop for the softly lit room. Neatly ordered around the perimeter were containment capsules large enough to house a human. Some were open, revealing a cushioned interior with machinery to maintain hibernation, while others were destroyed. Those that remained sealed were frozen in time, unaware of the reality that awaited them. 

Breaking the illusion of suspended animation, the rhythm of metallicly tinged thuds permeated the enclosure. 

A firm rapping on an undisturbed capsule disrupted the eerie serenity of the scene followed by a lax but commanding order, only partly muffled by the barrier between the caller and sleeper. 

"It's time, displaced one." 

1.) Try to move your body?
2.) Nod your head. 

Considering your drowsy state, moving proves to be quite difficult. However, you feel a particular numbness in your left arm. Or rather, what you thought was your arm.... 

!? You're taken aback by what you see when tilting your head to the left. A sharp contrast in skin color reveals an advanced prosthetic arm. The jet black exterior is only occasionally disrupted by vein like branches carrying an azure liquid throughout. 

1.) Say Nothing.
2.) "What the hell is this!?" 

Responding with a chortle, the enigmatic figure entertained the question. 

"What you've got there was the progenitor Huang Shi prosthetic. A lot of advancements in augmentation are thankful to you." 

Gauging the incredulousness in your face, the figure promptly beckons once again, with a little more urgency. 

"You'll have time for it to sink in while we walk, let's go."
