  storyText: "Temporal Isolation\r\n\r\nThe steady hum of a distant generator served
    as a backdrop for the softly lit room. Neatly ordered around the perimeter were
    containment capsules large enough to house a human. Some were open, revealing
    a cushioned interior with machinery to maintain hibernation, while others were
    destroyed. Those that remained sealed were frozen in time, unaware of the reality
    that awaited them. \r\n\r\nA firm rapping on an undisturbed capsule disrupted
    the eerie serenity of the scene followed by a lax but commanding order, only partly
    muffled by the barrier between the caller and sleeper. \r\n\r\n\"It's time, displaced
    one.\" \r\n\r\n1.) Try to move your body?\r\n2.) Nod your head. "
